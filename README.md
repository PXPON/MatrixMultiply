# MatrixMultiply
This repo will focus on implementing and benchmarking matrix multiplication usign CuPy vs NumPy, with reports on performance gains.

After I complete this, I have plans for the following projects:
GPU-accelerated matrix multiplication: Implement and benchmark matrix multiply using CuPy vs NumPy, with a writeup on performance gains.

Extend NumPy with a custom ufunc: Create a custom universal function (ufunc) in NumPy for a special operation (e.g., a numerical method or transformation).

Distributed numerical task: Use Dask to parallelize a numerical simulation or a large data array computation, showing scalability.

Contribute to open source: Pick a small issue in SciPy or CuPy repos â€” even documentation improvements tied to numerical accuracy or performance counts.
